Join And Kill The Giants (Catch The Giants)
Inspired by the dynamics of John Clash 3D, I proudly present my project - "Catch the Giant." Developed during my collaboration with the last studio, this game is a testament to readable, maintainable, and clean code.

Project Highlights:
Inspiration: Built on the foundation of John Clash 3D.
Purpose: Crafted for the latest studio I was part of.
Code Quality: Prioritized readability and maintainability.
Accessibility: Designed for anyone to easily understand and integrate the mechanics into their own projects.
Feel free to explore the project and I hope you enjoy the experience!
